# TMC5160 on a 3Dprinter Board
 TMC5160 using the pinheaders on a typical 3d printer controllerboard as inputs via an adapter board to a bigger general purpose tmc5160 50V 3-5A (Goal)

All files made in KICAD
(Work in progress)


todo:
bad footprint on RJ45 conn.
Clean up BOM (values and voltages)
74xx125 buffer footprint to wide
bigger fuse footprint (Automotive fuseholder?)
THT caps for H-bridge?
RJ45 pinout on silk?
clearer pin1 marking on 74xx125 buffers
Larger diameter holes on testpoints
I/O testpoints
